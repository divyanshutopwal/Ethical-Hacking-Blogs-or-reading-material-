NETWORKING

1. WHAT IS A NETWORK?
	NETWORK IS DEFINED AS A CONNECTION THAT CONNECTS THINGS TOGETHER FOR A SPECIAL PURPOSE.
	A COMPUTER NETWORK CONNECTS TWO OR MORE DEVICES TOGETHER TO TRANSFER LIMITLESS RANGE OF INFORMATION AND 	SERVICES.

2. PROTOCOLS 
	RULES THAT GOVERN HOW DEVICES COMMUNICATE AND SHARE INFORMATION ACROSS A NETWORK.
	IP,HTTP,SMTP

3. NETWORK REFERENCE MODEL 
	ALLOW PRODUCTS FROM DIFFERENT COMPANIES TO INTEROPERATE ON A NETWORK.

	OSI(OPEN SYSTEMS INTERCONNECT) AND DOD (DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE) ARE TWO WIDELY USED NETWORK REFERENCE 	MODEL.

4. BASIC NETWORK TYPES

	LAN - LOCAL AREA NETWORK (HIGH SPEED NETWORK THAT COVERS SMALL AREA OR A BUILDING. PRIMARY EXAMPLE IS 	ETHERNET)

	WAN - WIDE AREA NETWORK (WAN BASICALLY COVER WIDE GEOPOLITICAL AREA BY USING MULTIPLE LAN NETWORKS BUT ARE 	NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE) 

	MAN - METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK (DEFINED AS A NETWORK THAT CONNECT LAN ACROSS A WIDE CITY GEOGRAPHIC AREA)

	SAN - STORAGE AREA NETWORK (PROVIDE HIGH SPEED AND LOSSLESS ACCESS TO STORAGE DEVICES)

	VPN - VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK (ALLOWS INFORMATION TO BE SECURELY SENT ACROSS PUBLIC AND UNSECURE NETWORK)

5. NETWORK ARCHITECTURE

	HOST REFERS TO ANY DEVICE CONNECTED OVER A NETWORK AND CAN BE DEFINED AS A DEVICE ASSIGNED TO A NETWORK 	ADDRESS)

	A HOST CAN REQUEST DATA.
	A HOST CAN PROVIDE DATA.
	A HOST CAN DO BOTH REQUEST AND PROVIDE DATA.

	TYPES
	PEER TO PEER
		ALL HOST ON PEER TO PEER ARCHITECTURE CAN BOTH REQUEST AND PROVIDE DATA AND SERVICES.
		WINDOWS XP CONFIGURED SHARED FILES IS THE EXAMPLE OF PEER TO PEER ARCHITECTURE. 

	CLIENT SERVER ARCHITECTURE
		HOSTS ARE ASSIGNED SPECIFIC ROLES. CLIENT REQUEST DATA AND SERVICES STORED ON SERVERS.
		EXAMPLE - WINDOWS XP ACCESSING FILE FROM WINDOWS 2003 SERVERS.
		CLIENT/SERVERS NETWORKS CAN SCALE FAR LARGER THAN PEER TO PEER NETWORKS.
		DISADVANTAGE OF CLIENT/SERVER ARCHITECTURE IS THAT THE SERVER CAN PRESENT A SINGLE POINT OF 			FAILURE.

	MAINFRAME/TERMINAL ARCHITECTURE
		A SINGLE DEVICE (MAINFRAME) STORES ARE ALL DATA AND SERVICES FOR A NETWORK.PROVIDES CENTRALIZED 		MANAGEMENT AND SECURITY OF DATA.
		MAINFRAME PERFORMES ALL PROCESSING FUNCTIONS FOR DUMB TERMINALS. DUMB TERMINALS PERFORM NO 			PROCESSING.
		DUMB TERMINAL IS BASICALLY A KEYBOARD,MOUSE,DISPLAY.
		THIN CLIENT IS A FRAMEWORK THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED ON HARDWARE AND CAN BE ON TOP ON OTHER 			OPERATING SYSTEM.
		TWO TYPE OF THIN CLIENTS ARE
		RDP(REMOTE DESKTOP PROTOCOL) - DEVELOPED BY MICROSOFT 
		ICA(INDEPENDENT COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE) - DEVELOPED BY CITRIX
